# Hi, I'm Armand Kamffer

I'm an iOS Mobile developer interested in technologies such as SwiftUI, Combine, and REST Development.

I have worked on multiple iOS apps, mostly built in Swift and sometimes Objective-C. Going forward I see myself continuing to work on iOS app development, and maybe even some more REST backend development.
